## Train Yard
___
Train Yard is a C program I created to practice singly linked lists, text parsing, and building stable CLI's. The program simulates a train yard manager, allowing the user to create a train, manage carts, add and remove cargo, and print a detailed summary of the train. This program was completed during my time in Intro to Software Systems, but was not assigned work.
